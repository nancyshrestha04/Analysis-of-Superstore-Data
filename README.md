- As the most common reason besides the reason â€˜Not Givenâ€™ for return of the Tables was â€˜Wrong Itemâ€™, it is recommended that a thorough investigation is to be made in packing department.
- Same goes for all the product sub-category. 
- It is recommended to add another option like â€˜Others â€“ specifyâ€™ in the return reason in order to have an accurate reason for the returns.
